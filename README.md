# Dashboard Webpage Development

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a dynamic and responsive dashboard webpage showcasing frontend development skills. The dashboard features various interactive elements, including pop-ups, sliding menus, data fetching, and chart visualizations, demonstrating proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration.

## Features

### Layout
- Clean and user-friendly layout with a **header**, **sidebar menu**, and a **main content area**.

- Fetches data from an external API (e.g., a weather API or public data API).
- Displays fetched data in a **table** or **card format** in the main content area.
